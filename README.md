#README

Wrapper of libartnet for OF 007 on OSX 10.6 and 10.7.
May be useful for Linux and M$ too - see libartnet docs.

Can send to multiple artnet devices on the same network subnet if specifying sendRaw in the setup() function.

Receiving callback is untested but should work for a single artnet device. 

Based on code here:
